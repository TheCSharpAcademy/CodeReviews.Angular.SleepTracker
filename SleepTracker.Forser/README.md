# SleepTracker.Forser
Sleep Tracker project for the C# Academy Exercise.

- This is an application where you should record sleep time.
- You should create two projects: A .NET WebApi and an Angular app.
- You need to use Angular Material.
- You can choose whatever database solution you want: Sqlite, SQL server or whatever you're comfortable with.
- You can choose whatever ORM you want: Dapper, EF, ADO.NET.
- You should have a filter functionality, so I can show records per type and / or date.
- Your database should have a single 'Records' table.The objective is to focus on Angular, so we should avoid the complexities of relational data.
- This app needs to have a timer that will log your sleep once stopped and saved.
- Users should also be able to input their sleep time using a form.
- Your list of sleep records should have pagination, so you're not loading all records every time you visualise the list.
